# Simple Artwork Upload Platform

This is a lightweight web application built with **PHP** that allows users to upload and showcase their digital artwork.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this platform is to provide artists with a simple way to manage their portfolio. Users can register, log in, and upload image files which are then displayed on the main feed.

## 👤 Contributor Note
I am currently working on this project as a **contributor**. My focus has been on setting up the core PHP logic, the file structure, and the front-end styling.

## ⚠️ Current Status: Missing Database
> **Note:** The project is currently in a "logic-only" state. 
> 
> The application requires a **MySQL database** to function correctly. Specifically, the following features are pending database integration:
> * User authentication (Registration/Login).
> * Storing image metadata (file paths, titles, and artist names).
> * The `config.php` file needs to be updated with valid database credentials.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** PHP
* **Styling:** CSS3
* **Environment:** Compatible with XAMPP / WAMP / Apache servers

## 📂 File Structure
* `index.php` - The landing page and artwork gallery.
* `register.php` - Form for new user sign-ups.
* `view.php` - Detailed view for individual artworks.
* `style.css` - Custom styles for the platform.
* `config.php` - Database connection settings (needs configuration).
